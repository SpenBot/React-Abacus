# react-abacus
react abacus review project









- some good notes in the original project under:
  - 01-mini-projects/react-examples-comments/react-counters


# TO-DO

- needs a lot of styling.
- ideally, make it look like an abacus, with like a rest button for each one.
  - you click the bean and it moves to the other side, maybe makes a sound.


- whats this?
.Counter {
  display: inline-block;
  min-width: 30%;
}
